            <p>Karuppu Kavuni Rice, popularly known as <strong>black rice</strong>, is a nutrient-rich whole grain traditionally grown in Tamil Nadu, India.

            <h2>What Makes Karuppu Kavuni Rice Unique?</h2>
            <p>Unlike white rice, Karuppu Kavuni retains the bran layer, which is rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The deep black hue comes from anthocyanins, natural antioxidants also found in blueberries and blackberries. These antioxidants play a crucial role in protecting the body against free radicals, inflammation, and oxidative stress, which are often linked to obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic conditions.</p>
